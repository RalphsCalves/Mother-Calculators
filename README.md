# Mother-Calculators
I supply people with cheat sheets

The term "Mother Calculator" came from two things:

(1) the person I have learned from the most (Mother)
(2) the thing  I have learned from the least (Calculator)

My favorite way to study is creating cheat sheets. 
It helps me organize my mind before an exam, and it ends 
up being an accumulation of everything I learned.  
I would suggest that you make your own cheat sheet. 
Go ahead and use mine as a guide. 
Google is 1000% the best cheat sheet.
